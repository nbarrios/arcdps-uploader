# Arcdps-Uploader
This is an extension for Arcdps that allows you to preview and upload EVTC combat logs *in-game*.

## Usage
Grab the latest [release](https://github.com/datatobridge/arcdps-uploader/releases). Unzip and copy `d3d9_uploader.dll` to same directory as **Arcdps** (usually something like `C:\Program Files\Guild Wars 2\bin64`).

Use *Alt-Shift-U* to bring the uploader window up.

## Changelog
**0.8:**
- Cache all parsed logs to prevent any refresh delay for users with 500+ logs
- Add Wing 7 Boss Names and ID's
- Improve parsing accuracy (dps should match Elite Insights)

*Gw2raidar.com support will be removed in the next release.*

## ToS Compliance
This extension has minimal interaction with GW2 (basically it displays a window), and is essentially a QoL upgrade over uploading the logs yourself. It provides no inherent advantage over other players. As such, I believe it to be ToS compliant.
